				Hello and thank you for visiting!
			</div>
			<div>You'll be shown an image for a fraction of a second and then you will select "YES" or "NO" below it to indicate if, from what you saw, you would be interested in dating this person. (Don't worry if you're in a relationship or not looking, this experiement is just to get a sense of how much information we are able to glean from that first impression). Then you'll get to view additional pictures of that person for as long as you'd like and then again decide "YES" or "NO" based on the additional information you extract from the images.
